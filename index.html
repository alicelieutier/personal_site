        <p>I'm currently starting my own business helping companies create more open and supportive cultures for their teams through <consultancy</em>, <em>workshops</em> and <em>1:1 coaching</em>.</p>

        <p>My own brand of leadership centers on trust, authenticity and empathy.</p>
        <p>I can help with building supportive teams, creative problem solving, collaboration and more.</p>

        <p>I enjoy <em>deep conversations</em> and people say <em>my enthusiasm is infectious</em>.</p>
        
        <p>Between 2018 and 2022, most of my time was spent leading the coaching team at <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers</a>. This is a team of incredible, strong, intelligent and caring people who change the lives of hundreds of career changers each year by training them to become software developers.</p>

              <p>Alice is a wonderful, smart, clearheaded & emotionally intelligent coach. In the time I&apos;ve known her (I was a student at Makers Academy), I&apos;ve found that she straddles the line between being rational/ logical and deeply understanding and emotionally aware. She&apos;s open and honest, and has an amazing way of tapping into what you&apos;re experiencing and working with you to disentangle it all and gain clarity. I&apos;ve spoken to Alice about a range of things, from coding to imposter syndrome, to general life and career decisions. Each time, I&apos;ve ended up in a much more clear-headed space, with an action-plan of how to unstick myself from the problem, and a vision of what, to me, feels like the right way to handle my current situation. She&apos;s also a lot of fun, non-judgemental, and a really interesting person with a lot of insight!</p>
              <p>I would really recommend her to anyone looking for a coach ðŸ™‚</p>
