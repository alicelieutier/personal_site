      <p>I'm here to inspire people to <em>grow</em> and find joy.</p>
      <p>I enjoy <em>deep conversations</em> and people say <em>my enthusiasm is infectious</em>.</p>
      <div class="wrap">
        <p>Most of my time is spent leading the coaching team at <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers</a>. This is a team of incredible, strong, intelligent and caring people who change the lives of hundreds of career changers each year by training them to become software developers.</p>
         <p> Here's a <a href="https://blog.makersacademy.com/teach-the-world-to-code-a-brand-new-podcast-episode-with-our-head-of-coaching-alice-lieutier-518311f4915b">podcast episode</a> where I talk about training developers at Makers.</p>
        <p>ðŸ¦Š</p>
        <p>Outside of Makers, <em>I coach individuals</em> facing life-changing experiences.</p>
        <p>This typically takes the form of one or two coaching sessions per person, to support you in a <em>key moment</em>.</p>
        <p>Maybe you are considering different options in your life, or maybe you are struggling with confidence in a new environment. Or maybe you just want someone else to ask you the questions you may not be asking yourself.</p>
        <p>These coaching sessions are <em>free</em> but availability is limited. Don't hesitate to <a id="email" href="mailto:alice@lieutier.me">contact me</a> if you are interested and I'll let you know if and when I can coach you.</p>

            <p>Alice is a wonderful, smart, clearheaded & emotionally intelligent coach. In the time Iâ€™ve known her (I was a student at Makers Academy), Iâ€™ve found that she straddles the line between being rational/ logical and deeply understanding and emotionally aware. Sheâ€™s open and honest, and has an amazing way of tapping into what youâ€™re experiencing and working with you to disentangle it all and gain clarity. Iâ€™ve spoken to Alice about a range of things, from coding to imposter syndrome, to general life and career decisions. Each time, Iâ€™ve ended up in a much more clear-headed space, with an action-plan of how to unstick myself from the problem, and a vision of what, to me, feels like the right way to handle my current situation. Sheâ€™s also a lot of fun, non-judgemental, and a really interesting person with a lot of insight!</p>
            <p>I would really recommend her to anyone looking for a coach ðŸ™‚</p>
